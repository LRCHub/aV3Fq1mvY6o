Wake me up wake me up
wake me up when you come back
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
I can be your best friend
I can be your least friend
I can be your boy friend
but l don't wanna be
your ex-friend
Don't you know
this guy who sang a song
about the highest common factor
and so It's kind of how this is,
I'll tell you what it is
about all your questions
you have asked
Wake me up wake me up
wake me up when you come back
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
If the size
of the sky makes you frighten
then come back
And then cry so that
I might could hug you
これで5度目の別れ話です
でも今回はどこか違うんです
いつもの『忍法・記憶喪失』も
なぜか今回は効かないんです
「もういやだ」
って思っていたんなら
それでも僕はいいけど
「さよなら」
って言ったのは君なのに
なんで泣いたの?
Wake me up wake me up
wake me up when you come back
If that answer is"no",
what should I do?
Should I cry? Should I die?
Or go crazy and then fly
Better yet should I
kiss myself ドンマイ
Wake me up wake me up
wake me up when you come back
Pick me up pick me up
pick me up when you come back
Wake me up wake me up
wake me up when you come back
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
Pick me up pick me up
pick me up when you come back
Until then
I will save this song for you
Now come back now come back
now come back I'll take it back
I'll be here I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
