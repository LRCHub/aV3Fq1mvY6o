Wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you come back
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
～♪～
I can be your best friend
I can be your least friend
I can be your boy friend
But I don't wanna
be your ex-friend
Don’t you know
this guy who sang a song
About the highest common
factor and so
It's kind of how this is,
I'll tell you what it is
About all your questions
you have asked
Wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you come back
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
If the size of the sky
makes you frighten
then come back
And then cry
so that I might could hug you
これで5度目の別れ話です
でも今回はどこか違うんです
いつもの『忍法・記憶喪失』
もなぜか今回は聞かないんです
「もういやだ」
って思っていたんなら
それでも僕はいいけど
「さよなら」
って言ったのは君なのに
なんで泣いたの?
Wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you come back
If that answer is "no",
what should I do?
Should I cry?
Should I die?
Or go crazy and then fly
Batter yet should I kiss myself
ドンマイ
～♪♪～
Wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you come back
Pick me up
pick me up
pick me up
when you come back
Wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you come back
Pick me up
pick me up
pick me up
pick me up
Wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you come back
Wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you come back
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
Pick me up
pick me up
pick me up
when you come back
Until then
I will save
this song for you
Now come back
now come back
now come back
I'll take it back
I'll be here
I'll be here
I'll be waiting here for you
